- Scrape tweets in Python without the official Twitter (X.com) API (unlimited tweets) in 2024.
- Save them in a JSON format to then analyse the data later on.
- In this example, you can download the latest 100 tweets from @ElonMusk.
- To make it retrieve more or less than 100, check out https://github.com/bocchilorenzo/ntscraper for more information.

- First, you must run: **pip install ntscraper**

**Each time, you get: "Fetching error: Instance has been rate limited.Use another instance or try again later.", simply run the code again.**
